/**
 * Bootstrap State - Centralized state management for bootstrap lifecycle
 *
 * This module provides a pull-based mechanism for renderer to query bootstrap status,
 * complementing the push-based event system. This is particularly useful for:
 *
 * 1. HMR (Hot Module Replacement): When renderer reloads, main process won't re-emit
 *    the bootstrap:extended-ready event. Renderer can query current state instead.
 *
 * 2. Error Recovery: If renderer crashes and restarts, it can immediately know
 *    whether services are ready without waiting for timeout.
 *
 * 3. Race Conditions: Eliminates timing issues where renderer mounts after
 *    the event was already sent.
